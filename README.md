# Java + PostgreSQL Projects 💾

Welcome!  
This repository contains two solid Java projects integrated with PostgreSQL.  
They are designed to strengthen my skills in **SQL, JDBC, database modeling, and layered architecture (DAO, Service, Model)**.

Each project is console-based, well-structured, and ready to be extended or refactored.
